// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a = number 1
b = number 2
Sum = a + b

Write Sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

num = int("Enter a Number:")
mod = num % 2
if mod > 0:
   print("This is an odd number.")
else:
   print("This is an even number.")

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) 
var (num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)

b) 
num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 / 5

c) 
Find minimum of 5 num

Input num1, num2, num3, num4, num5

Min = num1

Is num2 < Min
Yes = Min = num2
No = Min not changed

Is num3 < Min
Yes = Min = num3
No = Min not changed

Is num4 < Min
Yes = Min = num4
No = Min not changed

Is num5 < Min
Yes = Min = num5
No = Min not changed

Print Min
End

Find maximum of 5 numbers

Max = num1

Is num2 > Max
Yes = Max = num 2
No = Max not changed

Is num3 > Max
Yes = Max = num 4
No = Max not changed

Is num5 > Max
Yes = Max = num 5
No = Max not changed

Is num2 4> Max
Yes = Max = num 2
No = Max not changed

Print Max
End

d)
Start
Set message = "These results are the minimum and maximum of 5 numbers."
Display message
End
